# Analyzing the Golden Age of Video Games

In this project, we delve into the evolution of video games from 1977 to 2020, examining the sales, critical acclaim, and player reception of the top 400 best-selling games. With the global gaming market's exponential growth, understanding the trends and qualities that define successful video games has become crucial for game developers and publishers.

## Data Overview

Our analysis is grounded in two main datasets:

- **Game Sales:** Contains information on game names, platforms, publishers, developers, copies sold, and release years for the best-selling games.
- **Reviews:** Offers critic and user scores for these games, providing insight into their reception.

## Key Findings

1. **Best-Selling Video Games:** We identified the top-selling games, with classics like "Wii Sports for Wii" and "Super Mario Bros. for NES" leading the chart. This indicates a wide interest span from 1985 to 2017, highlighting diverse player preferences over the years.

2. **Missing Review Scores:** A notable portion of games lacked review data, which posed a limitation in correlating sales to game quality directly.

3. **Critic and User Scores Analysis:** By examining critic and user scores, we aimed to pinpoint years that stood out in terms of game quality. Notably, 1998, 2004, and 2002 emerged as years with high average critic scores, suggesting periods of exceptional game releases.

4. **Investigating Outliers:** We scrutinized years with outstanding average scores but limited game releases, adjusting our analysis to focus on years with a significant number of reviewed games. This refined approach provided a more reliable overview of the critics' favorites.

5. **Player Preferences:** Players' top-rated years slightly differed, showcasing the subjective nature of game enjoyment. Years like 1997 and 1998 were highlighted, indicating potential golden ages of video gaming from a player perspective.

6. **Consensus Between Critics and Players:** A few years, such as 1998, 2008, and 2002, were celebrated by both critics and players, marking them as standout periods in video game history.

7. **Sales Analysis in Top Years:** Exploring sales data for these consensus years revealed the commercial success of games, adding another dimension to what might constitute the "golden age" of video games.

## Conclusion

The intersection of critical acclaim, player satisfaction, and sales success in 1998, 2008, and 2002 suggests these years could represent the golden age of video games. However, our exploration also underscores the importance of comprehensive review data across a broader range of games and years to fully understand the evolution of video game quality and its impact on the gaming industry.

## Further Exploration

Future analysis could expand on:

- A deeper dive into genre-specific trends to understand how different types of games contribute to overall perceptions of game quality.
- Longitudinal studies on how technological advancements and gaming platform shifts influence game design and player engagement.
- Comparative analysis of regional sales and preferences to uncover global patterns in video game popularity and reception.

This project highlights the multifaceted nature of video game success, illustrating the complex interplay between quality, reception, and commercial performance. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, so too will the criteria defining its golden ages.
